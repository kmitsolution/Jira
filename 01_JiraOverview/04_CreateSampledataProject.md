# Create Sample Project
Creating a sample project with Jira using sample data can help you get a feel for how Jira works without having to input your own data. Follow these steps to set up a Scrum project with sample data:

### Steps to Create a Sample Data Project in Jira

1. **Log In to Jira**:
   - Go to your Jira dashboard and log in with your credentials.

2. **Access Boards**:
   - On the Jira main navigation bar, click on the **Search** icon (usually represented by a magnifying glass).
   - In the dropdown, click on **View All Boards** or simply **Boards**.

3. **Create a New Board**:
   - In the Boards view, look for the option to **Create board**. Click on it.

4. **Select Board Type**:
   - You will be given a choice between **Scrum board** and **Kanban board**. Select **Scrum board**.

5. **Create a New Scrum Board**:
   - Choose **Create a board with sample data**. This will set up a Scrum board pre-populated with sample data to help you explore Jira’s functionalities.
   - Click **Next**.

6. **Set Up Your Project**:
   - Jira will prompt you to create a new project for this board. Fill in the required details such as:
     - **Board name**: Give your board a name (e.g., "Sample Scrum Project").
     - **Project key**: This is a unique identifier for your project.
     - **Project template**: Make sure Scrum template is selected.
     
7. **Create and Use the Sample Project**:
   - Click **Create**. Jira will set up a new Scrum project using the sample data.
   - The project will include various user stories, tasks, and other issues typically found in a Scrum project.
   - You can now navigate through the board, interact with the sample issues, and explore Jira’s features like sprints, backlog, and reporting.

### Additional Considerations

- **Explore Sample Data**: Use the pre-populated issues in the backlog to familiarize yourself with how issue tracking and sprint planning work in Jira.
- **Modify Sample Data**: Feel free to edit the sample issues, transitions, and workflows to better understand how you can customize Jira to fit your specific needs.
- **Use Tutorials**: Leverage Atlassian’s documentation and tutorials to get more insights into advanced features and best practices.

By following these steps, you'll have a Scrum project set up with sample data, allowing you to explore and understand Jira's capabilities thoroughly.
